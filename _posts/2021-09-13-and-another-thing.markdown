The article [An explorative study of factors associated with treatment in specialized mental health care centers among GP patients in Norway](https://rdcu.be/cxIco) is finally published (again on BMC Health Services Research, almost like a habit now).

We observed some interesting gender differences, as male patients were more likely than women to be treated in specialized mental health care (only after controlling for other factors). We try to explore som reasons, but may need some of the time tested _more research_ to illuminate what is really going on.
